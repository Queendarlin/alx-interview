# Minimum Operations

This project contains a method to calculate the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` H characters in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

## Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n):
    """
    Calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result
    in exactly n H characters in the file.

    :param n: int, number of H characters desired
    :return: int, minimum number of operations, or 0 if n is impossible to achieve
    """


### Make the Script Executable
Ensure the script is executable by setting the appropriate permissions:

```sh
chmod +x 0-minoperations.py
