# UTF-8 Validation

This project involves implementing a method to determine if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding. The method should handle multiple characters, each represented by a list of integers where each integer represents one byte of data.

## Concepts Needed

- **Bitwise Operations in Python**:
  - Manipulate bits using AND (`&`), OR (`|`), XOR (`^`), NOT (`~`), shifts (`<<`, `>>`).

- **UTF-8 Encoding Scheme**:
  - Understanding how characters are encoded into one or more bytes.

- **Data Representation**:
  - Work with data at the byte level, handling the least significant bits of integers to simulate byte data.

- **List Manipulation in Python**:
  - Iterating through lists, accessing list elements, and understanding list comprehensions.

- **Boolean Logic**:
  - Applying logical operations to make decisions within the program.
